### Description

<!--- Describe your changes if needed -->

<!--- Leave testing instructions if needed -->

Check all boxes that apply and review your code if you can't tick them all yet:

- [] Did you test your changes in logged out, mainnet logged in and devnet logged in modes?
- [] Did you test your changes in mobile, tablet and desktop modes?
- [] Did you test your changes with or without the Itheum Web2 API availability? (don't forget about "graceful fallback")
- [] Did you use reasonable user alearts and error messages? (and put them in language.ts)
- [] Did you leave the code base cleaner than you found it overall (done reasonable refactoring efforts wherever you felt that was needed)?
